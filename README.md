# Linear-Algebra-Examples
This repository contains examples of the Linear Algebra that underlie the statistics of OLS regression and portfolio optimization. Each step in the process is shown to gain greater understanding for someone who is familiar with OLS and portfolio optimization, but wants to "look beneath the hood".  The examples are in Excel, R, Julia, and Python.
